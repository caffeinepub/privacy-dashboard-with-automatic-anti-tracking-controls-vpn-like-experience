# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Incognibro app publicly/indexing ready (SEO basics + custom domain guidance) and ensure the branding name is consistently “Incognibro” everywhere user-visible.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-visible branding references from the old name(s) (e.g., “Privacy Shield”) to “Incognibro”, including the header brand text and HTML document title.
- Add basic SEO/indexing readiness for SPA deployment: robots.txt (crawl allowed), sitemap.xml (at least the root URL), and standard HTML metadata (title alignment + meta description) in English.
- Add custom-domain readiness documentation (DNS + Internet Computer-specific steps) and support configuring a canonical/public base URL so sitemap/canonical references match the deployed custom domain.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays “Incognibro” consistently, can be crawled with standard robots/sitemap/metadata in place, and includes clear instructions and configuration to publish under a custom domain with correct canonical URLs for SEO.
