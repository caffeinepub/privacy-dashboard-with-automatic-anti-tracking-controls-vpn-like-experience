  "summary": "Frontend adds a privacy dashboard UI with scanner, blocklist manager, and activity log, plus React Query hooks and a green/charcoal theme. Backend adds a Motoko actor with privacy settings and blocklist mutation scaffolding, but it appears to enforce authorization (trapping for unauthorized callers) and does not show the required default blocklist merge/reset behavior. Evidence of required generated image files being added is not present in the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend must handle anonymous/unauthenticated usage gracefully (defaults used until user signs in), without crashes.",
      "reason": "The backend privacy settings methods shown trap on missing permission, and the frontend calls getPrivacySettings even when using an anonymous actor. This would likely crash/throw rather than gracefully return defaults for anonymous users.",
