REQ-9 static robots.txt and sitemap.xml were added and index.html has SEO meta/description, but robots/sitemap contain placeholder domains and do not appear wired to the configurable canonical/base URL. REQ-10 has a setup guide and a frontend base URL config, but the guide content is truncated so IC-specific steps and the required Google-indexing disclaimer cannot be verified; backend custom-domain configuration APIs were added even though REQ-10 only required config/docs.",
